### JavaScript in the front, Markdown in the back.

This is our playbook for launching, operating, *ing "Welcome to Tech-sas".

The app itself is data driven from the Markdown files in the ["/src" directory](./src). Here are some common things to keep in mind when migrating the project to a new purpose (Curriculum, Questionnaires, etc):

1. The ["/src" directory](./src) should consist of a series of folders with numeric names, prefixed with chapter numbers.
2. The app will display a tag and title for each main folder.
3. Don't delete [archive.md](./src/archive.md) in the ["/src" directory](./src).
