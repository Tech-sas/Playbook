=======================

This is our playbook for launching, operating, *ing The Iron Yard Academy in new cities.

The app itself is data driven from the Markdown files in the ["/src" directory](./src). Here are some common things to keep in mind when migrating the project to a new purpose (Curriculum, Questionnaires, etc):

1. The ["/src" directory](./src) should consist of a series of folders with numeric names, prefixed with chapter numbers. For example, ["00-welcome"](./src/00-welcome), ["01-mission-culture"](./src/01-mission-culture), etc.
2. The app will display a tag and title for each main folder.
3. The app will respect capitalizations, so you can easily rename ["00-welcome"](./src/00-welcome) to ["00-Welcome"](./src/00-welcome) to capitalize that section title.
4. Don't delete [archive.md](./src/archive.md) in the ["/src" directory](./src).
