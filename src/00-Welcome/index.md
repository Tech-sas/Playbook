Howdy and welcome, city-slicker!

You made it to [Tech-sas](http://techsas.co) because you (_choose any of the following_):

- want to learn how to code,
- want to network with other Tech-sans,
- want some coffee,
- made it past our security guards

Our mission here today is to inspire greatness. Sounds really ambiguous, doesn't it!? Our goal is to raise awareness of the expanding Houston tech-and-startup scene, and cultivate a new community of creatives, professionals, entrepreneurs and coffee-snobs who bring in a wealth of talent and press to our growing and "far-cooler-than-other-cities" city.

Today, Tech-sans will spend the day learning basic website development, sharing local knowledge, talking local shop, and building local networks.

Our volunteer team of mentors will lead small groups through a short instruction this morning; and this afternoon we encourage each and every one of our attendees to build something to "take home" from the event.

**Got a question?** Ask a mentor, tweet out to [#welcometotechsas](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23welcometotechsas), or just flap your arms and make Angry Birds noises until someone questions your sanity.

Thank you for helping us nurture something special.
