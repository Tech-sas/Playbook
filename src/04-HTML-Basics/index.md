## What is markup?

Show a newspaper article and discuss how to tell a computer how to lay the article out. Identify pieces like headings, paragraphs, images. Then discuss how we need to tell the computer how to style it. Fonts, font sizes, margins, padding. This naturally leads into what markup is and CSS. This allows them to self-discover / rationalize HTML & CSS.

## The most common tags

There are many HTML tags, each with their own use, meaning, and purpose. When building web apps, however, you'll see a few tags uses over and over again. Knowledge of all modern HTML is, of course, crucial, but make sure you're well aquainted with these ubiquitous tags in particular:
