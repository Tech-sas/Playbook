In this section, students will be creating their first webpages with a focus on learning HTML markup.

## Breaking down a newspaper

Now look at a newspaper and as a group identify the different types of content.

- What is the heading for the newspaper? That would be the `h1`.
- What about images?
- Paragraphs?
- Subheaders?

## What is markup?

Markup is a method to help a computer identify content. Markup involves wrapping content with **tags**. So if we want to identify a section of text as a paragraph, then we would wrap the text in `<p></p>` tags.

~~~
  <p>I am a paragraph of text.</p>
~~~

### Remember to close tags!

~~~
  <h1>Cool awesome title!

  <p>Oh no! I forgot the closing tag on my h1!</p>
~~~

~~~
COOL FACT: Not all tags require closing tags.

## Beginner HTML tags

There are many HTML tags, each with their own use, meaning, and purpose. When building web apps, however, you'll see a few tags used over and over again.

Make a new webpage and try using each of these tags:

* `html`
* `body`
* `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`
* `p`
* `ul`
* `ol`
* `li`

If you are having problems coming up with content for your webpage, try making a cookie recipe webpage like: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/best-chocolate-chip-cookies/
