**Note**

Please don't worry about cramming everything in. Learning less things on a deeper level is a much better end result, and you will leave with something you can use and tinker with after the program.

## What is markup?

Show a newspaper article and discuss how to tell a computer how to lay the article out. Identify pieces like headings, paragraphs, images. Then discuss how we need to tell the computer how to style it. Fonts, font sizes, margins, padding. This naturally leads into what markup is and CSS. This allows them to self-discover / rationalize HTML & CSS.
