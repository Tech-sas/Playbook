This is a list of tools, software, and resources that can be used.

If you are a **beginner**, you can setup three things that we will use:

- The latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)
- The cloud-storage service [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
- And the text-editor, [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) (_just use the free trial_)

We will also use the service [Pancake.io](https://pancake.io/), which will serve a real website from your Dropbox folder.

More **advanced developers** may be interested in putting something up on one of these services:

- [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

- [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)
- [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/)
- [Parse](https://www.parse.com/) (_The Iron Yard - preferred_)
- [Dropbox Datastore API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore/sdks/js)
