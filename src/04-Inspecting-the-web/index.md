In this section, students will be looking at existing webpages on the Internet and discussing the HTML and CSS they see.

## View source

Go to some of your favorite sites and view the source. Discuss what you see on their source and what you learned for today.

## Updating existing styles

With Chrome's web developer tools, you can also update the styles directly. Don't worry the style is just changed for your local copy of the webpage.

Just think, before today the HTML and CSS would have been foreign and intimidating. Now you know what both are and how they work together to make webpages look good!
